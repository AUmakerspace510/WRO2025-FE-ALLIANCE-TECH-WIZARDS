# `masks.py` â€” Color Mask Definitions

This file defines color masks for use in image processing, specifically in the LAB color space. These masks allow the robot to reliably detect various colors in its environment, which is essential for stripe following, wall detection, and course logic.

## What are Color Masks?

A **color mask** is a set of lower and upper bounds in a color space (here, LAB) used to isolate pixels of a specific color from an image. For example, to find all "orange" pixels, you use the `rOrange` mask.

---

## Why LAB Color Space?

- **LAB** color space separates lightness (L) from color channels (A/B), making color detection more robust against lighting changes and shadows compared to RGB.
- Each mask is a pair of NumPy arrays: `[lower_bound, upper_bound]`.

---

## List of Masks Defined

- **rMagenta**: For magenta stripes.
- **rRed**: For red stripes.
- **rGreen**: For green stripes.
- **rBlue**: For blue stripes (used for one course path).
- **rOrange**: For orange stripes (used for the alternate course path).
- **rBlack**: For wall detection (black lines or walls).

All masks are defined as follows:
```python
rMagenta = [np.array([22, 150, 50], np.uint8), np.array([200, 200, 150], np.uint8)]
rRed     = [np.array([0, 150, 120], np.uint8), np.array([255, 220, 180], np.uint8)]
rGreen   = [np.array([0, 50, 0], np.uint8), np.array([255, 120, 255], np.uint8)]
rBlue    = [np.array([0, 120, 60], np.uint8), np.array([255, 160, 120], np.uint8)]
rOrange  = [np.array([0, 117, 150], np.uint8), np.array([255, 200, 200], np.uint8)]
rBlack   = [np.array([0, 105, 105], np.uint8), np.array([80, 151, 151], np.uint8)]
```

## How are Masks Used?

- **Imported** in `functions.py` and `main.py`.
- Passed into image processing functions like `find_contours()` to segment and find contours of the specific color within a region of interest (ROI).
- Used in stripe detection, wall following, and turn logic.

---

## Example Usage

```python
from masks import rOrange, rBlack

# In an image processing function:
orange_contours = find_contours(img_lab, rOrange, ROI3)
black_contours = find_contours(img_lab, rBlack, ROI1)
```
- This finds all orange stripes in the main ROI and all black wall contours in the left ROI.

---

## Additional Variable

- **lotType**: Set to `"light"` (purpose: for lighting condition or mode selection, but not actively used in main code).

---

## Why Is This Important?

Correct color mask definitions are critical for reliable robot vision.
- Too narrow: robot may miss stripes/walls under different lighting.
- Too broad: robot may detect noise or wrong objects.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If your robot fails to detect stripes or walls, you may need to tune these mask values for your particular lighting and camera.
- Use OpenCV tools to sample LAB values from your camera images in your actual environment.
