# models

This directory contains all the files related to the 3D models and designs for the project. It is organized into several sub-folders for easy navigation and access to different types of files.

## Directory Structure

- `models/`
  - `.stl Files/`: Contains the Stereolithography (.stl) files for 3D printing. These files are the final, ready-to-print models.
  - `3D Design Images/`: Includes various rendered images of the 3D models from different perspectives, as well as a documentation file. These are useful for visualizing the complete design.
  - `parts_dimensions/`: Houses detailed dimensional drawings and images for individual parts. This is crucial for manufacturing, assembly, and reference.

## Contents

### .stl Files

This folder holds the 3D printable files.

- **`WRO_CAMERA HOLDER BASE.stl`**: The base part for the camera holder assembly.
- **`WRO_CAMERA HOLDER.stl`**: The main body of the camera holder, which attaches to the base.
- **`WRO_LOWER CHASIS.stl`**: The bottom section of the robot's chassis.
- **`WRO_UPPER CHASIS.stl`**: The top section of the robot's chassis.

### 3D Design Images

This folder contains rendered images of the complete 3D design.

- **`3D Design Images.docx`**: A document that may contain additional details, descriptions, or a compilation of the images.
- **`Back View.jpg`**: A view of the model from the back.
- **`Camera Holder Isometric View.jpg`**: An isometric view specifically of the camera holder.
- **`Front View.jpg`**: A view of the model from the front.
- **`Isometric View with Labelling.jpg`**: An isometric view with key components labeled for identification.
- **`Isometric View.jpg`**: A general isometric view of the model.
- **`Left View.jpg`**: A view of the model from the left side.
- **`Right View.jpg`**: A view of the model from the right side.
- **`Top Right View.jpg`**: A top-down, slightly angled view of the model.

### parts_dimensions

This folder provides detailed dimensional drawings and images for the individual parts, organized by component.

- **`lower_chassis/`**:
  - `1.png` through `8.png`: A series of images showing various dimensions and features of the lower chassis.
  - `LOWER.png`: A general dimensional drawing of the lower chassis.
  - `PART_LOWER.jpg`: An image of the lower chassis part.

- **`upper_chassis/`**:
  - `1.png` through `7.png` (with `5.png` and `6.png` potentially missing): A series of images showing various dimensions and features of the upper chassis.
  - `PART-11.png`: An additional part-specific image for the upper chassis.

- **`CAMERA_HOLDER.png`**: A dimensional drawing or image for the camera holder part.
